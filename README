1. APPLIANCE CREATOR DESIGN GOALS

This is a first cut of the Appliance Creation Tool (ACT), a tool to create
Appliance Images from a kickstart file. This tool uses the Live CD Creator
API as well as patches to the Image Creation API originally written by
Daniel P. Berrange <berrange@redhat.com> to create a multi partitioned
disk image. This Disk image can then be booted in a virtual machine such as
Xen, KVM, and VMWare. Alternatively, it can be installed onto SD cards
or usb sticks for use on arm systems such as the PandaBoard, BeagleBoard, etc.


2. CREATING AN APPLIANCE IMAGE

To create an appliance image, the appliance-creator tool is used. Super 
user privileges are needed. The tool is more or less self-documenting, 
use the --help option to see options.

Build the appliance, this used the example kickstart file included in 
the rpm others are available in the spin KickstartPool
# appliance-creator -n ThinCrust --config /usr/share/doc/appliance-tools-%{version}/aos-rawhide.ks

Run using libvirt (requires libvirt virt-manager libvirt-python python-virtinst)
# virt-image ThinCrust.xml

Installing an arm image requires installing via xzcat
# xzcat <arm disk image> >/dev/sdcard
